# React-Cat-Gallery
A gallery of random cat images, built using React and thecatapi

This program was built using create-react-app.<br>
The original design was used as a test task, and could be found at 'https://www.figma.com/file/HFB96W7Vbajtx18ZIwIvoz/MI-2022---Frontend'
As of current version of this application, it only Shows general design pattern with no images, slightly changed due to time constraints. This will be updated in the nearest future.
the easiest way to run this on your pc will be to create-react-app and change the 'src' folder to the folder of this app.
